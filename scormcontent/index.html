                            The oldest classical British and Latin writing had little or no space
                            between words and could be written in{' '}
                            <Link
                                text="boustrophedon"

                            (alternating directions). Over time, text direction (left to right)
                            became standardized. Word dividers and terminal punctuation became
                            common. The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original
                            paragraphos, similar to an underscore at the beginning of the new
                            group.[2] The Greek parágraphos evolved into the pilcrow (¶), which in
                            English manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline
                            between sentences.
                        </Paragraph>

                        <Paragraph>
                            Ancient manuscripts also divided sentences into paragraphs with line
                            breaks (newline) followed by an initial at the beginning of the next
                            paragraph. An initial is an oversized capital letter, sometimes
                            outdented beyond the margin of the text. This style can be seen, for
                            example, in the original Old English manuscript of Beowulf. Outdenting
                            is still used in English typography, though not commonly.[3] Modern
                            English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by indenting the
                            first line. This style can be seen in the (handwritten) United States
                            Constitution from 1787. For additional ornamentation, a hedera leaf or
                            other symbol can be added to the inter-paragraph white space, or put in
                            the indentation space.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>
                            A second common modern English style is to use no indenting, but add
                            vertical white space to create block paragraphs. On a typewriter, a
                            double carriage return produces a blank line for this purpose;
                            professional typesetters (or word processing software) may put in an
                            arbitrary vertical space by adjusting leading. This style is very common
                            in electronic formats, such as on the World Wide Web and email.
                            Wikipedia itself employs this format.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <ResultButton />
                    </main>
